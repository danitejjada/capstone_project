Project Overview:

My project was designed for job seekers. More specifically, it was designed for individuals who have an “ideal” job in mind and are trying to find jobs similar to it that match their skill set and or are located in a particular city or stat in the in the U.S.

How it works:
A user (job seeker) inputs the job title, city, state and skill set for the job they are looking for as well as the job description for their ideal job (Indeed job posting). The program returns the jobs posted on Indeed that match the constraints and whose job descriptions are most similar to the “ideal” job.

How to Run the Code:

1. Run df_builder.py (already run)
	- Scrapes Indeed.com for relevant jobs
2. Run code in model.ipynb
	- outputs most similar jobs given specifications
